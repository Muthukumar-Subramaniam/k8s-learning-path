- Best for quick local testing
- No need for external tools

> ✅ Easy setup  
> ❌ Not production-ready

## ⚙️ 2. kubeadm (Production-Grade, Self-Managed)

### ➤ `kubeadm init` / `kubeadm join`
- Bootstraps a real Kubernetes cluster on Linux VMs or bare metal
- Suitable for IaaS and on-prem
- You manage everything: control plane, networking, HA, etc.

> ✅ Flexible and customizable  
> ❌ Requires ops knowledge and maintenance

## ☁️ 3. Managed Cloud Services

### ➤ EKS (AWS), AKS (Azure), GKE (GCP)
- Fully managed Kubernetes control plane
