# 🧩 Kubernetes Installation Considerations

This document outlines key considerations when deciding **where** and **how** to install Kubernetes in different environments.

---

## 🛰️ Where to Install Kubernetes?

Kubernetes can be installed in two primary environments:

- ☁️ **Cloud**
- 🏠 **On-Premises**

---

## ☁️ 1. Cloud Environments

Ideal for elasticity, faster provisioning, and native integration with cloud services.

---

### 🔹 IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

> Self-managed Kubernetes on cloud-based Virtual Machines (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VM, GCP Compute Engine)

- ✅ **Pros:**
  - Full control over cluster architecture and components
  - Flexibility to design custom networking, storage, and security

- ⚠️ **Cons:**
  - Requires Kubernetes operations expertise
  - You manage upgrades, availability, and maintenance

- 🧠 **Considerations:**
  - Multi-AZ control plane for high availability
  - Secure access with cloud IAM
  - Proper resource sizing to avoid over/under-provisioning

---

### 🔹 PaaS (Managed Kubernetes Services)

> Kubernetes provided and managed by cloud vendors (e.g., AKS, EKS, GKE)

- ✅ **Pros:**
  - No need to manage control plane
  - Integrated monitoring, IAM, storage, and networking
  - Easier to set up and operate

- ⚠️ **Cons:**
  - Less control over low-level configuration
  - Vendor-specific limitations and pricing

- 🧠 **Considerations:**
  - Review service limits (e.g., max pods/node)
  - Choose regions/zones for HA
  - Understand billing implications of autoscaling and networking

---

## 🏠 2. On-Premises Environments

Suitable for organizations needing data locality, compliance, or control over infrastructure.

---

### 🔹 Bare Metal

> Kubernetes is installed directly on physical servers without virtualization.

- ✅ **Pros:**
  - Best performance (no virtualization overhead)
  - Full control over the hardware and networking
  - No cloud dependency

- ⚠️ **Cons:**
  - Requires in-house hardware and provisioning strategy
  - High operational complexity
  - Must manually manage redundancy and failover

- 🧠 **Considerations:**
  - Plan for load balancing (e.g., MetalLB or BGP)
  - Use redundant power and network for HA
  - Design IP management and server lifecycle processes

---

### 🔹 Virtual Machines (On-Prem VMs)

> Kubernetes is installed on VMs hosted in an on-prem hypervisor environment (e.g., VMware, KVM, Hyper-V)

- ✅ **Pros:**
  - Easier node lifecycle management compared to bare metal
  - Can snapshot or clone VMs for faster recovery
  - Leverages existing virtualization infrastructure

- ⚠️ **Cons:**
  - Some performance overhead from virtualization
  - Shared hypervisor resources can introduce noisy-neighbor issues

- 🧠 **Considerations:**
  - Ensure VM sizing matches workload requirements
  - Use templates to speed up node provisioning
  - Integrate with existing VM backup/restore policies

## 🧮 General Cluster Design Considerations

| Category         | Key Considerations                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Control Plane    | High availability, backup/restore, failure domains       |
| Networking       | CNI plugin, IP pools, service type support (LoadBalancer)|
| Storage          | CSI support, dynamic provisioning, performance tuning    |
| Security         | RBAC, API server access control, network policies        |
| Monitoring       | Centralized logs, metrics pipeline, alerting             |
| Scalability      | Autoscaling, capacity planning, node pools               |
| Maintenance      | Upgrade strategy, patching, node reboots, lifecycle mgmt |

---

## 📌 Summary

Choose your Kubernetes installation path based on:

- ⚙️ **Control level needed**
- 💰 **Budget and staffing**
- 🌐 **Integration with your existing infra**
- 🛡️ **Security, performance, and compliance needs**

> 🧠 **No one-size-fits-all** — align the setup with your operational maturity and workload criticality.
